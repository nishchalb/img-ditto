# histogram-transfer
histogram-transfer is a small python script with a command line interface that 
allows you to transfer the color style from one image to another. It works by 
using the [histogram matching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram_matching)
technique on the channels of an image. Example outputs are shown below.

Transferring style from:

![ from image ](examples/ny_from.jpg)

To this image:

![to image](examples/ny_to.jpg)

Results in :
![New York result](examples/ny_lab.jpg)
